# Leatspeak Translator

#### _C#, .NET: Leatspeak Translator, 12/16/2019_

## Description
Leetspeak uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337" and "Epicodus" might become "3pic0duz".

## Application should have:

Write a `LeetspeakTranslator` class with a `Translate()` method that translates a provided string into Leetspeak using the following rules:

- "e" should be replaced with "3".
- "o" should be replaced with "0".
- Capital (not the lowercase "I" should be replaced with "1".
- "t" should be replaced with "7".
- "s" should be replaced with "z", unless it is the first letter of a word.
